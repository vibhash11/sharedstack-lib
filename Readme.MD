# A library for sharing stack between two processes. 

The library implementation is present in shstacks.h and shstacks.c along with detailed description of each process.
The key-path present in shstacks.c and stacks.c will need to replaced with their actual path.

How to use:
1. Run -> bash dynamic.sh or bash static.sh
2. Two files should be created s1 and s2.
3. Run the above two files on two different terminals and follow the on-screen instructions.
